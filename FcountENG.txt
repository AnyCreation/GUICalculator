ElemING = Number element / (int/float)
ElemSTR = String element / (+, -, *, /, ^)

1. If there is ElemING₁ and after it another ElemING₂, then [ElemING₁ is multiplied by 10 and ElemING₂ is added].

2. If there is ElemING₁ and after it another ElemING₂ and ElemING₁ equals 0, then [ElemING₂ is divided by 10].

3. If between ElemING₁ and ElemING₂, there is ElemSTR (ElemSTR = Rules) (+, -, *, /, ^), then [ElemING₁ and ElemING₂ interact with each other according to ElemSTR].

4. If there is ElemING₁ with a comma and after it another ElemING₂ without a comma, then [ElemING₂ is added to the end]. --> 0.x, y --> 0.xy, z --> 0.xyz, q -->...

5. If after ElemSTR₁ there is another ElemSTR₂, then [ElemSTR₁ is removed].

6. If ElemSTR₁ is "/", then [ElemING₂ cannot be 0].
