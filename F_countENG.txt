ElemING = Number element
ElemSTR = Element string / (+, -, *, /, ^)

1. if there is an ElemING₁ and after it another ElemING₂, then [ElemING₁ is multiplied by 10 and ElemING₂ is added].

2. if there is an ElemING₁ and after it another ElemING₂ and ElemING₁ is equal to 0, then [ElemING₂ is divisible by 10].

3. if between ElemING₁ and ElemING₂, there is ElemSTR (ElemSTR = Rules) (+, -, *, /, ^), 
then [ElemING₁ and ElemING₂ act on each other according to ElemSTR].

4. if after all ElemSTR₁ there is another ElemSTR₂, then [ElemSTR₁ is deleted]
